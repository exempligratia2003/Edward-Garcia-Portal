        <h1>How my Music Journey Went</h1>
        <p>I'm a Philippines-based lo-fi hip-hop song producer. In 2018, while I was a high school student in my tenth
            year, I started my path into producing music. I first dabbled in various kinds of EDM genres, including
            future house, tropical house, future bounce, and future bass. But that December, I was introduced to lo-fi
            hip-hop by a classmate. I was immediately drawn to this genre because of its soothing, soulful feelings, and
            it has since taken focal point in my life.</p>
        <p>I began releasing official beats on streaming platforms in 2020. In the summer of that year, I hit a growing
            milestone—getting 1,000 listens on my first album, "24 Hours." It was at this moment that I started to
            produce music more consistently. In an attempt to get their support, I created a small web presence,
            developed a fan base, and told friends about my musical endeavors.</p>
        <p>My inconsistency began in the early months of 2021 when I found it difficult to continue producing songs
            because of other priorities like schooling. I had no external accountability because I was an independent
            producer without a manager, which resulted in times when I was idle and unproductive. I lost connections as
            a result of my inconsistent behavior, and both my streams and monthly listener count decreased.
            Notwithstanding these obstacles, I never completely stopped improving. My career kept advancing, and my
            statistics never fell to zero.</p>
        <p>I didn't let this difficult time stop me from producing lo-fi beats because my music was still being heard by
            others. Their encouragement inspired me to keep going on, and I never gave up.</p>
        <p>I've been devoted to making music ever since, constantly improving my technique. I am self-taught, like many
            bedroom producers, and I occasionally ask my producer buddies for advice. I also rely on YouTube courses. I
            have mostly gone it alone throughout my career, navigating the music world on my own and without much help
            from others. My distinct sound and method of music production have been formed by this journey, which has
            enabled me to produce genuine and emotional lo-fi hip-hop beats.

                <h2>My Style of Music</h2>
                <p>The hip-hop style of lo-fi music (duh) is the style of music I make I mostly create my tunes by
                    scratch using virtual instruments like piano, electric piano, bass guitar, and more. I don't sample
                    music—not the kind that sounds like drum or SFX samples, but the kind that sounds like old records.
                    Making lo-fi music has been simpler because I attempted making trap music back then as well, as trap
                    music is closely related to hip-hop.</p>
                <p>I usually try to replicate the vintage feel of the hip-hop scene by incorporating elements of the
                    boom-bap style of hip-hop music into my lo-fi beats. I am still able to produce classic trap
                    music—that is, hip-hop songs that artists used to rap on. I can also create generic house music,
                    which is the kind that has a square wave bass and sounds like deep house. However, I am no longer
                    able to create EDM outside of those.</p>
                <p>The truth behind why I quit EDM is because I can't mix very well (I was making music with FL mobile;
                    you know what that means). Unlike in lo-fi music, you have a lot of freedom on how you want your mix
                    to sound like. It doesn't have to sound good, because lo-fi doesn't have to sound clean. The
                    imperfections of lo-fi music are also its beauty.</p>
                <p>Note that I'm not that kind of an old soul person. I am a 2003 born kid and yes, I know a lot of old
                    songs in the past, but the kid version of me cared less about who he's listening to.</p>
                <p>To be honest, I'm not sure if my beats are considered “lo-fi hip-hop” anymore. For me it's just like
                    generic boom-bap. I don't know. XD</p>
